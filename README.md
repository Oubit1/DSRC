# Dynamic mask Stitching-guided Region Consistency for Semi-supervised 3D Medical Image Segmentation
by Jiahui Wang, Mingfeng Jiang*, Dongsheng Ruan, Yang Li, Tao Tan
## Introduction
This repository is for our paper '[Dynamic mask Stitching-guided Region Consistency for Semi-supervised 3D Medical Image Segmentation]
## Requirements
This repository is based on Pytorch 1.9.1, CUDA11.1 and Python 3.6.5
## Usage

### Dataset
We use [the dataset of 2018 Atrial Segmentation Challenge](http://atriaseg2018.cardiacatlas.org/).
We use [the dataset of Pancreas-CT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qzFUtkHx-46kFvHE7RAMhjAdo6dmn4iT/view?usp=sharing/).
### Preprocess
If you want to process .nrrd data into .h5 data, you can use `code/dataloaders/preprocess.py`.
### Pretrained_pth
